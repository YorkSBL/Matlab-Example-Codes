# Matlab-Example-Codes

Handful of Matlab codes provided "as is" for reference. Most of these codes were developed for teaching to help demonstrate various concepts tied to computational physics and signal processing. Some codes require Toolboxes (e.g., hilbert.m from the Signal Processing Toolbox), but for the most part are generally designed to be stand-alone and not black-boxy. Please feel free to post comments/suggestions to help improve things. Thanks!
